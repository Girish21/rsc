# RSC (React Server Components)

_(Disclaimer: We will be covering RSC using [waku](https://github.com/dai-shi/waku). A minimalistic RSC framework where we can try out RSC outside of Next.js)_

## What is RSC?

In simple terms RSC allows you to write React components that run on the server. Instead of rendering on the client, or the entire page being rendered on the server, RSC allows you to render only the components that need to be rendered on the server and send only the minimal amount of JavaScript to the client. Since React components can run on the server, we can write components that directly interact with the database, or other services, without having to write a separate API. Or we can write components that are only rendered on the server and never sent to the client, the benifit of this is we can keep heavy components off the client and only send the minimal amount of JavaScript to the client.

> **_Note: Waku does not do SSR currently, meaning the initial HTML does not have the the components rendered. But the whole point of RSC is that it will be rendered on the server, so the initial HTML should have the components rendered ðŸ¤”. We will uncover more about RSC in the following sections and understand what RSC actually mean_**

### Time for some code

> We will not be going over framework specific code, but rather the concepts of RSC. So if you are not familiar with Waku, you can still follow along.

Navigate to [`examples/01`](./examples/01) and run `npm install` and `npm run dev`. Open up <http://localhost:300>, the app should be running.

We have the basic starter from Waku (have kept it to the bare minimum to focus on understanding the technology). We have two components in the whole page. One with the text `This is a server component` and another one with the text `This is a client component` and an interactable button with a counter.

Let's take a closer look at the components. Open up [`examples/01/src/App.tsx`](./examples/01/src/App.tsx), `App` is a simple component that takes in a `name` prop and renders some text and renders a `Counter` component. The `App` component is also a server component. But where did we specify that `App` is a server component? We didn't. By default all components are server components. Since it is a server component, none of the code in the `App` component will be sent to the client.

Now let's take a look at the [`Counter`](./examples/01/src/Counter.tsx) component. Right off the bat we can see that at the top of the file we have marked the file with a `"use client"` directive. This lets the compiler know that this component is a client component and should be bundled and sent to the client. The component itself is a simple counter component that increments the counter on every click.

But how does it all fit together ðŸ¤”.

### Architecture

> **_Note: RSC architecture is not set in stone, and can vary from framework to framework. We will be covering the architecture of Waku._**

![RSC Architecture](./assets/basic-rsc-architecture.png)

As we have seen in the previous section an app built with RSC will have server components and client components. For every request to the server the server has to execute the server component and send it to the client. The client component is bundled and sent to the client (note: The client component is not rendered on the server in Waku instead special `voids` are created, but Next.js renders the client component during the SSR phase and sends it to the client along with the rendered HTML).

In the browser, the index HTML is downloaded and React is initialised. All the module dependencies are downloaded which includes the rendered server components and the client components. React interprets the rendered server components response and constructs a VDOM. It then fills in the voids in the VDOM with the client components (remember the client components are not rendered on the server). The client components are then commited to the DOM and the app is ready to be interacted with.

This is the high level overview of how RSC works. Let's take a look at the different components in detail.

## Server Components

Server components are like anyother React component with a couple of differences. Server components can be an `async` component, meaning they can await async function calls in the component body where the execution of the component `suspends` until the async function call is resolved.

The other important distinction is that no client side code can be executed in the server component. This means that we cannot use hooks like `useState` or `useEffect` in the server component. This is because the server component is executed on the server and not on the client. Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` are client side hooks and cannot be executed on the server. And `Context` cannot be used in the server component as well.

One more important thing to note is that server components are not rendered on the server. Instead they are executed on the server and the response is sent to the client. The client then renders the server component response and fills in the voids with the client components. **_Wait!_** Isn't this contradictory to what we said earlier? We said that server components are rendered on the server and client components are rendered on the client. Well, yes and no. This is the architecture of Waku, but Next.js renders the both the server and client components on the server and sends it to the client along with the rendered HTML (on the initial request, on subsequent requests from the client onlt the RSC output is fetched).

### So what does the output of a server component look like?

The output of RSC is nothing but a funcky JSON representation of React VDOM ðŸ™‚. Yes that's right! RSC produces VDOM and sends it to the client. The client then reconstructs the VDOM from the serialised JSON and commits it to the DOM by filling in the `voids` with Client Components.

A sample serialised output of a RSC component

```txt
1:I{"id":"/assets/rsc0-40fcedd3.js","chunks":["/assets/rsc0-40fcedd3.js"],"name":"Counter","async":false}
0:["$","div",null,{"style":{"border":"3px red dashed","margin":"1em","padding":"1em"},"children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Hello ","Waku","!!"]}],["$","h3",null,{"children":"This is a server component."}],["$","$L1",null,{}]]}]
```

> It clicked to me when I read RSC as React Serialised Components instead of React Server Components ðŸ˜….

## Client Components

When a module is marked with `"use client"` directive, the compiler knows that this module is a client component and should be bundled and sent to the client. Client components are like anyother React component. They can use hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` and can use `Context` as well. It is important to note that all the modules that are imported in the client component are also bundled and sent to the client. And it is not required to mark each and every module with `"use client"` directive. The compiler will automatically mark all the modules that are imported in the client component as client components.

> Note: In Waku, the client components are not rendered on the server, instead voids are created and sent to the client. But Next.js renders the client components on the server and sends it to the client along with the rendered HTML on the initial request.
